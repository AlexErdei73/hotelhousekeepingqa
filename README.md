This is my own version of the [Inventory Application](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-inventory-application). 
This is a real-world app with real business data. The housekeeping department is responsible for cleaning the guest rooms in
the hotel. The hotel sends questionaries to the guests about their stays. The guests can give a score between 1 and 10 to the
cleanliness of the guestroom. The hotels use a percentage measure to describe guest satisfaction. This measure is the ratio of 
the number 9 and 10 scores to the total number of scores. We get this percentage measure in every month and year.

This program follows the daily tasks of the cleaners on the housekeeping department. We can input the data of the daily tasks 
manually or from a report file (text file). The same is true for the guest feedback data. When all the data is available, the
program filters the guest feedback data between the cleaners and calculates the percentage values for each cleaner and other
statistical measures. This can be used for quality assurance purposes.
